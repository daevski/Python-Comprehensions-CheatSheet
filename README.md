# Python Comprehensions CheatSheet
A Jupyter notebook of Corey Schafer's [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dt4OGnU5sM) explaining Python Comprehensions.
* View the notebook on [Github](https://github.com/daevski/Python-Comprehensions-CheatSheet/blob/master/Python%20Comprehensions%20CheatSheet.ipynb)
* Render the notebook in [Jupyter's nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/daevski/Python-Comprehensions-CheatSheet/blob/master/Python%20Comprehensions%20CheatSheet.ipynb)

Note: There is a known issue with some markdown links in the table of contents with the Github and nbviewer examples above [Jupyter notebook #2709](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/2709). Despite this, the links work very well within actual Jupyter Notebooks.
